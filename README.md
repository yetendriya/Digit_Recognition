Digit Recognition using Keras
Welcome to the Digit Recognition using Keras project!
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook file that demonstrates a basic implementation of digit recognition using the popular deep learning library, Keras. 
The code in this notebook utilizes a neural network to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
About the Dataset:
The code in this notebook uses the MNIST dataset, a collection of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9).
Each image is labeled with the corresponding digit.
